# Recursive Macroeconomic Theory Figures

This repository replicates the figures from the 3rd edition of the book "Recursive Macroeconomic Theory" by Lars Ljunqvist and Thomas J. Sargent.

The code to create the figures is here, but you should consult the book for information on what is being described by the pictures.

The figures in the book are organized by chapter, section, and number. If you were looking for figure x.y.z then it would be found at the path `RMTFigs/Chapterx/Fig_x_y_z.py`.

Contributions are welcomed and encouraged. Submissions should be in Python and follow [this guide](http://quantecon.org/developer_resources.html).
