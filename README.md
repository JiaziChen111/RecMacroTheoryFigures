# Recursive Macroeconomic Theory Figures

This repository replicates the figures from the 3rd edition of the book "Recursive Macroeconomic Theory" by Lars Ljunqvist and Thomas J. Sargent.

The code to create the figures is here, but you should consult the book for information on what is being described by the pictures.
